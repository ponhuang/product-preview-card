## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

According to RWD tips from YouTube, they suggest not using fixed properties. In the beginning I set the size with rem, but when making media query, and it occurs some issues. Therefore, in the media query setup the properties to % and vh, in order to keep the desing better.
